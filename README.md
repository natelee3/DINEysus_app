# DINEysus Web App 
DigitalCrafts week 6 group front-end project
Developed: 6/7/21 - 6/14/21

## Description
DINEysus takes its inspiration from Dionysus, the Greek diety of festivity. Once you enter your address, the app gives you several options of nearby restaurants within your search radius to select.
